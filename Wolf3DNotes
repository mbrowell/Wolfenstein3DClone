BIG TOPICS:
+Rendering engine!
-Physics engine!

Other topics:
+Engine generalization
+Better scratchpad support
-Improve texture class (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
+Some way to separate game and engine data
+Add higher level rendering conrtructs (shaders, materials, meshs, transforms)
+Add some form of automatic shader selection
-Add some form of primitives (rectangles, spheres, cones, pyramids)
+More flexible transform class (default values for projection and camera)
=Non-perspective view (orthogonal view)-Texture manipulation (translation, rotation, scale)
-Increased texture control (filtering, formatting)
+More friendly constructors
-Window should have more properties (centre position, fullscreen, mouse locking?)
-Better vector math (normalization, +=, commonly used vector constants, Swizziling support)
-Options class/system
+Game object class
-Make naming more consistent
-Make it simpler to set mesh parameters
-Simpler texture coordinate generation
-Make all time based on seconds rather than nanoseconds
-Give vector classes a copy constructor and an interpolation method
-Transparency support
-Sprite support
-Efficient vector comparisons
-Some method of displaying text.
